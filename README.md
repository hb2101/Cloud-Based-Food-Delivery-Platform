Natural language photo search via Amazon Lex and OpenSearch

Web-based frontend for uploading and searching photos

Serverless backend with Lambda functions and API Gateway

IAM roles and permissions configured for secure access

Architecture
Frontend: Static HTML/CSS/JS using apigClient.js to communicate with backend

Backend:

index-photos.py: Lambda function to process image uploads and label indexing

search-photos.py: Lambda function to process search queries using OpenSearch

AWS Services:

S3 (photo storage)

Lambda (serverless compute)
